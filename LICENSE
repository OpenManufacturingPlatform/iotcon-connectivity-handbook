RAND-RF (Royalty-Free) Mode

1.	Licensing Commitment.  For materials other than source code developed by the 
Working Group, each Working Group Participant agrees that it will offer to all 
applicants a royalty free, nonexclusive, worldwide, non-sub licensable, perpetual 
patent license to its Necessary Claims on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory 
terms to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, sell, and distribute conformant 
implementations of any Approved Deliverable adopted by that Working Group only to the 
extent it implements the Approved Deliverable and so long as all required portions of 
the Approved Deliverable are implemented.  Source code developed by the Working Group 
is subject to the license set forth in the Working Group charter.  

2.	Exclusion.  Prior to the adoption of a Draft Deliverable as an Approved Deliverable, 
a Working Group Participant may exclude Necessary Claims from its licensing commitments 
under this agreement by providing written notice of that intent to the Working Group 
chair (“Exclusion Notice”). The Exclusion Notice for issued patents and published 
applications must include the patent number(s) or title and application number(s), as the 
case may be, for each of the issued patent(s) or pending patent application(s) that the 
Working Group Participant wishes to exclude from royalty-free licensing commitment set 
forth in Section 1 of this patent policy. If an issued patent or pending patent application 
that may contain Necessary Claims is not set forth in the Exclusion Notice, those Necessary 
Claims shall continue to be subject to the licensing commitments under this agreement. The 
Exclusion Notice for unpublished patent applications must provide either: (i) the text of 
the filed application; or (ii) identification of the specific part(s) of the Draft 
Deliverable whose implementation makes the excluded claim a Necessary Claim.  If (ii) is 
chosen, the effect of the exclusion will be limited to the identified part(s) of the Draft 
Deliverable. The Executive Director will publish Exclusion Notices.

3.	“Necessary Claims” means claims of a patent or patent application, other than design 
patents and design registrations, that are: (i) owned or controlled by a Steering Member
/Associate or its Affiliate now or at any future time; and (ii) are infringed by 
implementation of the normative portions, including the normative elements of optional 
portions, of applicable Approved Deliverable that is within Scope, where that infringement 
cannot be avoided by another technically reasonable non-infringing alternative for implementing 
that Approved Deliverable.  Necessary Claims do not include any claims: (a) that read solely 
on an implementation example included in that Approved Deliverable; (b) other than those claims 
set forth above, even if contained in the same patent as Necessary Claims; (c) that are 
infringed by any enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or 
portion thereof that complies with that Approved Deliverable, but are not themselves expressly 
set forth in that Approved Deliverable; (d) that are infringed by the implementation of other 
technologies developed elsewhere but referred to in the body of that Approved Deliverable; 
(e) that are infringed by any portions of any product and any combinations thereof the purpose 
or function of which is not required for conformance with the applicable Approved Deliverable; 
or (f) that are infringed by any software code set out in that Approved Deliverable for purposes 
of illustration, sample implementation, or reference.
