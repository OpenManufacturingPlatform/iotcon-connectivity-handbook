[< Chapter 04: Views on Edge Computing](04_3_Operational_View.md)

## 5 Outlook
In this paper, different views were taken on the topic of edge computing in a manufacturing context. Each of the views, the infrastructural, the applicational, and the operational view, had a look at basic services and processes needed in different lifecycle phases. Looking ahead, the following topics are the main drivers for future digitized production scenarios:

_Device compatibility_: Devices complying with the above-described services and architectures are a success factor for scalable and stable rollout scenarios. This will get increasingly important in the future.

_Data semantic_: Data insights play a central role for most IIoT applications, and the availability of semantic information is a critical component to enable such insights. Semantic information unified across an enterprise is important for further developing of edge solutions for the Industrial IoT and the interaction between edge and central platforms.

_Openness_: Orchestrating the increasing number of different standards and services will be an important ongoing challenge. In order to create tailored business value, it is important that standards are open in terms of specifications, interfaces, and implementation.

_Data sovereignty_: Edge computing is a fundamental part of industrial cloud infrastructures to ensure the sovereign usage and processing of data that can be distributed across multiple platforms and vendors. The different usage scenarios and requirements fulfilling sovereignty must be taken into consideration.

The working group will address these in an open manner. If you want to participate, please feel free to contribute to our public GitHub space<sup>4</sup>.
