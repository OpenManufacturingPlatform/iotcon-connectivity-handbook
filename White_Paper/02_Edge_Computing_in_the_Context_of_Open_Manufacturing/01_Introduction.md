## 1 Introduction: The Importance of Edge Computing
Current approaches to implement IoT solutions focus on registering, man- aging, and connecting IoT devices directly to the cloud. The main chal- lenge of these solutions has typically been the transmission of raw data from a device to the cloud where the data was processed, filtered, or aggregated to generate business value.

In our last white paper [OMP IOTCON 2020]<sup>1</sup>, we described how this direct connectivity approach could not cover manufacturing requirements, creating the need for edge computing. For example, industrial devices typically generate significantly higher volumes of data than conventional IoT devices resulting in increased costs and latency times for the data transmission to the cloud. Particularly in manufacturing, reaction times to critical events must be minimized and special security considerations must be met.

By moving processes down from the cloud to the edge layer at the plant site, edge computing can help mitigate these issues and bridge the gap between data generation, storage, and processing. This helps to improve response times and save bandwidth. This means that some data processing and storage are shifted from the cloud to the edge level in the industrial context, resulting in a tailored combination at both levels to realize Industrial IoT use cases.

Edge computing has recently attracted a lot of interest; however, there is no consensus on a standardized definition and architecture for edge computing. Therefore, this publication approaches the topic of edge computing from a manufacturing use case perspective with three different views on it: an infrastructural, an application, and an operational view. Based on this approach, an edge computing frameworkâ€™s core characteristics and components are identified and described. The main contribution of this paper is to outline edge computing in a manufacturing setting and start moving the sector towards a common understanding.
